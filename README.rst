Safepy (rhymes with safety) is a latency and fault tolerance library for Python 3.5 (or greater) inspired by `Hystrix <https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix>`_, `Cloud Design Patterns <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568099.aspx>`_, `AWS Architecture Blog <https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/>`_ and many others.

How to use the library
----------------------

You can either use the mechanisms as decorators:

.. code-block:: python

    from safety import retry

    class ProfileService(object):
        @retry(attempts=3, base_delay=1)
        async def get_profile(self, username):
            ...

Or to dynamically recreate protected methods:

.. code-block:: python

    from safety import retry

    class ProfileService(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.get_profile = retry(attempts=3, base_delay=1)(
                self.get_profile
            )

        async def get_profile(self, username):
            ...

Retry
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from safepy import retry

    class ServiceA(object):
        @retry(attempts=3, base_delay=1)
        async def call():
            ...

Notes
^^^^^

* The default ``retry`` is an alias for ``retry_with_jitter_backoff``, a retry mechanism which uses `jitter backoff <https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html>`_. For exponential backoff use ``retry_with_exponential_backoff``.
